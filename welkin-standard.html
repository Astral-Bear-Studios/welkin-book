<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Welkin is an information language. Welkin stores three independent
structures: a tree of nodes, a hypergraph between nodes, and a tree of
node labels. These structures can be recovered and compared using a
unique encoding. This document aims to be self-contained, bootstraping
Welkin to provide a finitistic basis for all information.</p>

<h2>Appendix A: Boostrap File</h2>
<h1>Bootstrap</h1>
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The Bootstrap File (Appendix A) has the
encoding</p>
<p>We prove this in the following calculations: <em> TODO: import this
from a text file. </em></p>
<p><em> In Creole, maybe put this into a block? </em></p>
<p>(1) 0, 1 =&gt; {0, 1}</p>
<p>(3) "start" - { 0, 1} -&gt; "word" =&gt; ("start", {0, 1},
"word")</p>
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document specifies the Welkin information language.</p>
<p>Welkin stores information in a bigraph. A bigraph consists of a tree,
hypergraph, and set of labels. Together, these components make bigraphs
a universal information format. This enables structures to be identified
and compared.</p>
<p>The rest of this section serves as an <strong>informal guide</strong>
to this document. See "Organization" for the mimimal specification.</p>

<ul>
<li>Self-Contained
<ul>
<li>Rely on few undefined notions.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This document completely describes the Welkin language,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 9f41ba4 (Started adding encodings and informal proof of
unambiguity) (See "Syntax" for more details). This allows Welkin to be
fully self-contained.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> each section should be read <strong>in
order</strong>. For the minimal specification, read <strong>Regular
Expressions</strong> in <strong>Syntax</strong>, followed by the
Bootstrap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax
<ul>
<li>Provides the basis for Welkin and all other sections</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Semantics
<ul>
<li>Explains how Welkin nodes are encoded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bootstrap
<ul>
<li>Derives each line in the bootstrap file.</li>
<li>Each derivation can be independently checked, but the entire proof
is provided <strong>once and for all</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We conclude with the bootstrap. This section</p>
<h2>Conventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artifacts must be copied <strong>identically.</strong> They are
listed below.
<ul>
<li>`boostrap.welkin` is located in Appendix A.</li>
<li>`derivation.welkin` is located in Appendix B.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We write (n) for the n-th line in the bootstrap file.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Semantics</h1>
<h2>Equality on Terms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two strings are equal if they contain the same strings, in
order.</li>
<li>Two numbers are equal if $q(a) q(b).$</li>
</ul>
<h2>Valid Strings</h2>
<ul>
<li>No relative members at toplevel (with length 2).</li>
<li>No duplicate members, graphs, or connections.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Welkin Information Graphs</h2>
<p><em> TODO: to be self contained, define trees, hypergraphs, and the
label tree as strings accepted by certain grammars</em> A <strong>Welkin
Information Graph (WIG)</strong> is a structure $G (T, H, L)$ with:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tree --T--,</li>
<li>A hypergraph --H--,</li>
<li>A tree --H-- isomorphic to --T-- called the *label tree.*</li>
</ul>
<h2>AST ()</h2>
<ul>
<li>Units:</li>
<li>Members are words of units</li>
<li>Connections are WIGs with</li>
<li>Graphs are WIGs with
<ul>
<li>Derived terms as children</li>
<li>Ordered triples are arcs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Encoding</h2>
<p>The *encoding* $E(G)$ of the WIG $G$ is the unique string where</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes are listed in breadth-first order</li>
<li>Leaves are terms ending with "\#"</li>
<li>Edges are enumerated, starting from 0. They are included in nodes:
<ul>
<li>s means source,</li>
<li>c means connector,</li>
<li>$t$ means target.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<p>This section introduces the Welkin grammar.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we introduce regular expressions in a self-contained way.
This ensures no amgiguities arise in the rest of this document.
<ul>
<li>Regular expressions are defined using nodes. In particular,
<strong>any combinations of symbols needed for this document are
explicity defined</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Next, we define terminals and LR grammars.</li>
<li>Finally, we present the grammars for Welkin texts and encodings
solely with regular expressions, ensuring that these grammars are
completely specified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>We leave five symbols undefined. Each symbol is written in typewriter
font.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are two symbols called <strong>bits</strong>: `0` and
`1`.</li>
<li>There are three symbols called <strong>variables</strong>: `b`,
`b*`, and `S`.
<ul>
<li>`b` is a <strong>bit</strong></li>
<li>`b*` is the <strong>bit node</strong></li>
<li>`S` is the <strong>successor symbol</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is one symbol called the <strong>derivation operator</strong>:
`-&gt;`</li>
</ul>
<p>These symbols obey the following rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>(R0) `b -&gt; 0`</li>
<li>(R1) `b -&gt; 1`</li>
<li>(RS) `Sb -&gt; b`</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>byte</strong> is `bbbbbbbb`.</p>
<h2>Encodings</h2>
<p>A <strong>character in US-ASCII</strong> is a byte starting with
`0`:</p>
<p>`0bbbbbbb`.</p>
<p>An <strong>encoding</strong> `E` is a sequence of bytes separated by
a new character `c`:</p>
<p>`(b+ c)+`.</p>
<p>For US-ASCII, the encoding is displayed in Table ?.?. Characters up
to `00011111`, as well as `01111111`, were historically used as control
characters. For the purpose of this Standard, we exclude them. However,
any extensions of US-ASCII can be accepted; see Section ?.?.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>symbol</th>
<th>character</th>
<th>symbol</th>
<th>character</th>
<th>symbol</th>
<th>character</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We write any US-ASCII character in double quotes.</p>
<h2>Terminals</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>layout</strong> character is US-ASCII whitespace: [</li>
<li>A <strong>digit</strong> is (0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Atoms</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>string node</strong> is delimited with either single
quotes `'` or double quotes `"`. More precisely, these are the following
regular expressions: <strong> </strong> We say `w` is the
<strong>contents</strong> of the string.</li>
<li>Identifiers are strings without layout:</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>=======</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers are words without layout characters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>This section provides an informal overview of the Welkin grammar.
Although each term in our EBNF is carefully defined, EBNF is a separate,
intricate language. To avoid any possible confusion, this grammar is
embedded into the Bootstrap.</p>
<p>We use the following notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Productions include lower-case characters and can end with "?".</li>
<li>Spacing:
<ul>
<li>Two nonterminals separated by a space can have any number of
whitespace characters.</li>
<li>Two nonterminals combined with "." have no characters inbetween
them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Welkin grammar is given in Table ?.?.</p>
<pre><code>    start: term &quot;,&quot; start end | empty
    term: graph chain
    chain: &quot;-&quot; graph? &quot;-&gt;&quot;
        | &quot;&lt;-&quot; graph? &quot;-&quot;
        | &quot;-&quot; graph? &quot;-&quot;
        | empty
    graph?: graph | empty
    graph: name contents? | contents
    name?: name | empty
    name: import.unit.path
    import: &quot;.&quot;.dots
    dots: &quot;.&quot; dots | empty
    path: &quot;.&quot;.unit.path
    unit: string | identifier
    string: STRING
    identifier: IDENT 
    end: &quot;,&quot; | empty</code></pre>
<h3>Unambiguity</h3>
<p>This section informally demonstrates that the Welkin grammar is
unambiguous. We rely on external results that are beyond the scope of
this Standard. For epistemological concerns, see Section
`Bootstrap`.</p>
<p>Following (), we calculate the first and follow sets for the grammar.
As there are no first and follow set collisions, this grammar is LL(1),
and hence is unambiguous. (The regular expressions used in unit can be
expressed in LL(1) grammars, and hence, concatenated with the rest of
the grammar.)</p>
