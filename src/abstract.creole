Welkin is an information language. Welkin stores three independent structures: a
tree of nodes, a hypergraph between nodes, and a tree of node labels. An
Information Graph has a unique encoding that identifies its
structure. Using this encoding, the original
Information Graph may be recovered. 
This document bootstraps Welkin to provide
a finitistic basis for all information.
