  Welkin is an information language. Welkin stores three independent structures: a
  tree of nodes, a hypergraph between nodes, and a tree of node labels. An
  Information Graph has a unique encoding. Using this encoding, the original
  Information Graph may be recovered. This document "bootstraps" Welkin to provide
  a finitistic basis for all information.
