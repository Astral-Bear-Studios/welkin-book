<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Welkin is an information language. Welkin stores three independent
structures: a tree of nodes, a hypergraph between nodes, and a tree of
node labels. These structures can be recovered and compared using a
unique encoding. This document aims to be self-contained, bootstraping
Welkin to provide a finitistic basis for all information.</p>
