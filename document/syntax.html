<h1>Syntax</h1>
<p>This section introduces the Welkin grammar.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we present character encodings to extend ASCII from Section
Basis.</li>
<li>Next, we define terminals and present our conventions on
grammars.</li>
<li>Finally, we present the grammars for Welkin texts and encodings
solely with regular expressions, ensuring that these grammars are
completely specified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Terminals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strings use either single or double quotes. We separate both
definitions for clarity.</li>
<li>Tokens:</li>
</ul>
<h2>Character Encodings</h2>
<p>In order to support character encodings broadly, we define the
following.</p>
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let `c` be a new symbol. A (character)
<strong>encoding</strong> `E` is a sequence of bytes separated by `c`:
`(b+c)+`. In other words, encodings are defined by two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>(E+B) `(b+.c)+ -&gt; b+.c`</li>
<li>(E+I) `(b+.c).(b+.c)+`</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definition. (Interpretation into US-ASCII)</strong></p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>This section provides an informal overview of the Welkin grammar.
Although each term in our EBNF is carefully defined, EBNF is a separate,
independent language that, if not done carefully, may introduce
ambiguities. To avoid any possible confusion, the full grammar and its
notation is embedded into the Bootstrap.</p>
<p>We use the following notation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Productions include lower-case characters and can end with "?".</li>
<li>Spacing:
<ul>
<li>Two nonterminals separated by a space can have any number of
whitespace characters.</li>
<li>Two nonterminals combined with "." have no characters inbetween
them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Welkin grammar is given in Table ?.?.</p>
<pre><code>    start: term &quot;,&quot; start end | empty
    term: graph chain
    chain: link graph? link | empty
    link: &quot;&quot;&lt;-&quot; | &quot;-&gt;&quot; | &quot;-&quot;
    graph?: graph | empty
    graph: name contents? | contents
    name?: name | empty
    name: import.unit.path
    contents?: contents | empty
    contents: &quot;{&quot; term &quot;}&quot;
    import: &quot;.&quot;.dots | empty
    dots: &quot;.&quot;.dots | empty
    path: &quot;.&quot;.unit.path
    unit: string | identifier
    string: STRING
    identifier: IDENTIFIER
    end: &quot;,&quot; | empty</code></pre>
<p>For the encoding, see the regular expression in Section 3.?.</p>
<h3>Unambiguity</h3>
<p>This section informally demonstrates that the Welkin grammar is
unambiguous. For proofs of all claims made here, see Section
`Bootstrap`. We present an informal proof here.</p>
<p>Following (), we calculate the first and follow sets for the grammar.
As there are no first and follow set collisions, this grammar is LL(1),
and hence is unambiguous. (The regular expressions used in unit can be
expressed in LL(1) grammars, and can thus be concatenated with the rest
of the grammar.)</p>
