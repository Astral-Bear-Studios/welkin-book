<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document specifies the Welkin information language.</p>
<p>Welkin stores information in a bigraph. A bigraph consists of a tree,
hypergraph, and set of labels. Together, these components make bigraphs
a universal information format. This enables structures to be identified
and compared.</p>
<p>The rest of this section serves as an <strong>informal guide</strong>
to this document. See "Organization" for the mimimal specification.</p>
<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Self-Contained
<ul>
<li>Rely on few undefined notions.</li>
<li>Provide unambiguous, complete instructions to interpret its
specification.</li>
<li>Have an unambiguous grammar, semantics, and universal encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expressive
<ul>
<li>Express any relational structure with a sufficient amount of
space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Arbitrarily Extensible
<ul>
<li>Enable any additions to Welkin texts and encodings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Universal Identification
<ul>
<li>Provide a universal encoding to compare structures.</li>
<li>Make it possible to completely recover a bigraph through its
encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This document completely describes the Welkin language, in both
syntax and semantics. Welkin allows binary extension of US-ASCII. This
enables arbitrary extensions to different character sets. However, this
document <strong>does not</strong> cover these extensions. in both
syntax and semantics. Welkin is defined for binary extensions of
US-ASCII. This enables arbitrary extensions to different character
sets.</p>
<p>This document <strong>does not</strong> cover extensions of the
Welkin grammar. In particular, this document only defines US-ASCII, and
no other character set is mentioned. (See "Syntax" for more details).
This allows Welkin to be fully self-contained.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> each section should be read <strong>in
order</strong>. For the minimal specification, read <strong>Regular
Expressions</strong> in <strong>Syntax</strong>, followed by the
Bootstrap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax
<ul>
<li>Provides the basis for Welkin and all other sections</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Semantics
<ul>
<li>Explains how Welkin nodes are encoded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bootstrap
<ul>
<li>Derives each line in the bootstrap file.</li>
<li>Each derivation can be independently checked, but the entire proof
is provided <strong>once and for all</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We conclude with the bootstrap. This section</p>
<h2>Conventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Artifacts must be copied <strong>identically.</strong> They are
listed below.
<ul>
<li>`boostrap.welkin` is located in Appendix A.</li>
<li>`derivation.welkin` is located in Appendix B.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We write (n) for the n-th line in the bootstrap file.</li>
