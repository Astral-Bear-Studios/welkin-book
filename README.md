âš  **Warning: This repository is a WIP. This standard is in its early stages and does not have substantial text. Please wait to submit any issues, and stay tuned for updates.**

This repository stores the **Welkin Standard.** This document formally specifies the syntax and semantics of Welkin.

Welkin is a customizable language to store information from any subject matter. All Welkin files are compiled into the same data structure, called an Information Graph. The aim of this structure, to *determine the underlying structure of any subject.* To do so, Welkin compares the structure of different notes through special encodings. For instance, a musician could encode their musical development and compositions into a Welkin file and compare their results to a mathematician's theory. In this regard, Welkin's ultimate goal is to provide a Universal Information Format for *all* information, including annotations, notes, and entire blueprints.

# Accessing the Standard

There are three places you can read the Standard.
- multiple pages: [index.html](document)
- single page: [welkin-standard.html](welkin-standard.html)
- original Creole text files: [source](source)
All of these options are hosted online (TBD). You can read any of these through GitHub, or you may download them. **We recommend
downloading this repository to have access to all documents.**

**Warning:** the Creole files **may not** render correctly on GitHub. The 
[tool GitHub uses](https://github.com/larsch/creole?tab=readme-ov-file)
has not been updated in 10 years and has pending issues. Additionally, while we use back ticks (\`) for monospaced text, these are not in the original Creole grammar and will **NOT** render correctly on GitHub.
