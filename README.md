âš  **Warning: This repository is a WIP. This book is in its early stages and does not have substantial text. Please wait to submit any issues, and stay tuned for updates.**

This repository stores *Welkin: An Information Language*, also known as the Welkin Book. It provides a philosophical basis for the language, as well as a formal specification for several key components.

*Update of November 15, 2023: I have decided not to include CFLT into this book. I will explain more details on [my blog.](https://logsofhumanisticlogic.wordpress.com) For the time being, it is possible to express any concept from First Order Logic. In time, I will prove that you can do more, and I will use Welkin files to do so!*

Welkin is a customizable language to store information from any subject matter. 

It is possible to manually parse and evaluate the resulting .welkin files, but for ease, long-term use, and large scale projects, there is a program can manage them. The current implementation of this program is [PyWelkin (WIP)](https://github/astral-bear/pywelkin).


# Installation

You can read single files in this repository and find what you need. Alternatively, you can view welkin-book.pdf for one file.


# Generating a PDF

You can manually compile your own PDF, but you will need several packages:

Guide across different systems: TBD
