âš  **Warning: This repository is a WIP. This standard is in its early stages and does not have substantial text. Please wait to submit any issues, and stay tuned for updates.**

This repository stores the **Welkin Standard.** It formally specifies the syntax and semantics of Welkin. *A high-level specification is provided for parsers, but machine specific details are beyond the scope of this standard. For these details, see Stratus (TBD).* 

Welkin is a customizable language to store information from any subject matter. All Welkin files are compiled into the same data structure, with the aim to *determine the underlying structure of any subject.* To do so, Welkin compares the structure of different notes with this data structure. For instance, a musician could encode their musical development and compositions into a Welkin file and compare their results to a mathematician's theory. In this regard, Welkin's ultimate goal is to provide a Universal Information Format for *all* information, including annotations, notes, and entire blueprints.
