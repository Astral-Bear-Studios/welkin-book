âš  **Warning: This repository is a WIP. This book is in its early stages and does not have substantial text. Please wait to submit any issues, and stay tuned for updates.**

This repository stores *Welkin: An Information Language*, also known as the Welkin Book. It provides a philosophical basis for the language, as well as a formal specification for several key components.

*Update of November 15, 2023: I have decided not to include CFLT into this book. I will explain more details on [my blog.](https://logsofhumanisticlogic.wordpress.com) For the time being, it is possible to express any concept from First Order Logic. In time, I will prove that you can do more, and I will use Welkin files to do so!*

Welkin is a customizable language to store information from any subject matter. 

It is possible to manually parse and evaluate the resulting .welkin files, but for ease, long-term use, and large scale projects, there is a program can manage them. The current implementation of this program is [PyWelkin (WIP)](https://github/astral-bear/pywelkin).


# Contents 

- welkin-book.pdf contains the complete guide on Welkin, including some major results. It is the best place to start to get an overall understanding of Welkin and different ways to use it. Note, however, that this is not a complete characterization of Welkin's abilities.
- welkin-standard.pdf contains Chapter 3 on the Welkin Standard. This is a must for official implementations.
- grammars contains text based versions of Welkin grammars. While these are listed out in the standard, grammars is the definitive source for direclty writing an official parser for a Welkin variant.
- .auctex-auto can be ignored or deleted, unless you are an emacs user (in which case, keep it!)


# Generating a PDF

You can manually compile your own PDF, but you will need several packages:

-   pdflatex
-   bibtex
-   makeindex

Guide across different systems: TBD
