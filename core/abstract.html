<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Welkin is an information language. Welkin stores three independent
structures: a tree of nodes, a hypergraph between nodes, and a tree of
node labels. These structures can be recovered using a unique encoding.
Structures can be compared by comparing their encodings. This document
aims to be self-contained, bootstraping Welkin to provide a finitistic
basis for all information.</p>
