<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This document specifies the Welkin information language.</p>
<p>Welkin describes information as the combination of a tree,
hypergraph, and set of labels. Together, these form the basis for
storing information in a universal format.</p>
<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<p>The design goals of Welkin are the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-Contained
<ul>
<li>Provide unambiguous, complete instructions to interpret its
specification.</li>
<li>Rely on few undefined notions.</li>
<li>Have an unambiguous grammar, semantics, and universal encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expressive
<ul>
<li>Express any relational structure with a sufficient amount of
space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Arbitrarily Extensible
<ul>
<li>Enable any additions to Welkin texts and encodings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Universal Identification
<ul>
<li>Provide a universal encoding to compare structures.</li>
<li>Make it possible to completely recover an Information Graph through
its encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This document completely describes the Welkin language, in both
syntax and semantics. Welkin allows binary extension of US-ASCII. This
enables arbitrary extensions to different character sets.</p>
<p>This document <strong>does not</strong> cover extensions of the
Welkin grammar. In particular, this document only defines ASCII, and no
other character set is mentioned. (See "Syntax" for more details). This
enables Welkin to be fully self-contained.</p>
